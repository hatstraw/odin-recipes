    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Gravlax or graved salmon is a Nordic dish consisting of salmon that is cured using a mix of salt,
        sugar and dill. It is garnished with fresh dill or sprucetwigs and may occasionally be
        cold-smoked afterwards.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb fresh salmon fillet, skin on</li>
        <li>1/4 cup salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp crushed black pepper</li>
        <li>1 large bunch fresh dill</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine the salt, sugar, and crushed black pepper.</li>
        <li>Spread half of the dill on a large piece of plastic wrap. Place the salmon fillet skin-side down on the dill, 
            and then cover the fillet with the salt mixture.</li>
        <li>Top the salmon with the remaining dill and wrap the plastic wrap tightly around the fillet.</li>
        <li>Place the wrapped salmon on a tray or dish and refrigerate for 48-72 hours, turning the fillet every 12 hours to 
            ensure even curing.</li>
        <li>After curing, remove the salmon from the plastic wrap and gently scrape off the dill and curing mixture.</li>
