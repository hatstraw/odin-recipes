    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Skyr is a soured milk cheese that hails from Iceland. It&rsquo;s been made for over a thousand 
        years that we know of. It is believed that some version of skyr predates Viking settlement of 
        Iceland (874 CE, though evidence of habitation exists from around 800 CE), as Norway used to 
        have a tradition of skyr-making as well. The primary difference between skyr and other yogurts 
        or soured milks is that it is traditionally made with skimmed milk that has rennet added at the 
        same time the culture is. Rennet is also what makes skyr a technical cheese rather than a yogurt
        or similar. </p>
