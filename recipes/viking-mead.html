    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Mead, a fermented honey-based beverage, was a popular drink among the Vikings. This recipe offers a simplified
        version for home brewing.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 lbs honey</li>
        <li>1 gallon water</li>
        <li>1 packet wine or mead yeast</li>
        <li>1/2 cup raisins (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup orange or lemon zest (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, heat the honey and water over medium heat, stirring until the honey is fully dissolved. Do
            not boil.</li>
        <li>Allow the honey mixture to cool to room temperature, then transfer it to a sterilized fermenting container.
        </li>
        <li>Add the yeast and any additional flavorings, such as raisins or citrus zest. Seal the fermenting container
            with an airlock.</li>
        <li>Allow the mead to ferment for 2-4 weeks, or until the bubbling in the airlock slows down.</li>
        <li>Rack the mead into a secondary fermenting container, leaving any sediment behind. Allow the mead to age for
            an additional 2-6 months, or until it reaches your desired flavor and clarity.</li>
        <li>Bottle and enjoy chilled from a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.5moonsun5.com%2Fproduct%2Fgame-of-thrones-stark-house-viking-drinking-horn-mug-wolf-carved-tankard-drink-mead-beer%2F&psig=AOvVaw0OH0b3F0-46mVBC2Aq8m7t&ust=1706015765069000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBMQjRxqFwoTCICHkpmK8YMDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE"
